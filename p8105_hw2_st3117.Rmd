## Problem 1 Table Cleaning
```{r}
# import data
transit = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  gather(key = routes_number, value = routes_name, route1:route11) %>% 
  separate(routes_number, into = c("remove1", "routes_number"), sep = 5) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(routes_name)) %>% 
  mutate(
  entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", yes = TRUE, no = FALSE),
  routes_served = paste(routes_number, routes_name, sep = "_")) %>% 
  select(line:station_longitude, routes_served, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  arrange(line, station_name)

transit


```

The dataset "transit" is a `r ncol(transit)` by `r nrow(transit)` table.\
It contains line, station_name, latitude, longitude, routes_served, entry, vending, entrance_type and ADA compliance.\
I started by importing the dataset and clean the variable names. Then, used gather function doing a wide to long transpose; used separate function getting routes_number by itself; used filter function removing “NA”s in routes_name; used ifelse function converting entry to a logical variable; combined routes_number and routes_served to a single variable routes_served as requested; seleted the variables as requested; and arrange them by line and station_name.\

It is not a tidy dataset since the routes_served encodes both routes_number and routes_served.
