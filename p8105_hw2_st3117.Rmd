## Problem 1_1 Table Cleaning
```{r}
# import and clean data
transit = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  gather(key = routes_number, value = routes_name, route1:route11) %>% 
  separate(routes_number, into = c("remove1", "routes_number"), sep = 5) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(routes_name)) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", yes = TRUE, no = FALSE)) %>% 
  select(line:station_longitude, routes_number, routes_name, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  arrange(line, station_name)

transit

```

The dataset "transit" is a `r ncol(transit)` by `r nrow(transit)` table.\
It contains line, station_name, latitude, longitude, routes_number, routes_name, entry, vending, entrance_type and ADA compliance.\
I started by importing the dataset and clean the variable names. Then, used gather function doing a wide to long transpose; used separate function getting routes_number by itself; used filter function removing “NA”s in routes_name; used ifelse function converting entry to a logical variable; seleted the variables as requested; and arrange them by line and station_name.\

This is a tidy dataset.

## Problem 1_2
```{r}
# How many distinct stations are there?
distinct(transit, line, station_name) %>% 
  nrow()

count(distinct(transit, line, station_name))

# How many stations are ADA compliant?
filter(transit, ada == TRUE) %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name) %>% 
  nrow()

count(filter(transit, ada == TRUE) %>% distinct(line, station_name))


# What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?
  
count(filter(transit, vending == "NO" & entry == TRUE) %>% distinct(line, station_name)) /
  count(filter(transit, vending == "NO") %>% distinct(line, station_name))


```



```{r}
filter(transit, routes_name == "A") %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, routes_number, routes_name) %>% 
  nrow()

count(filter(transit, routes_name == "A") %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, routes_number, routes_name))

filter(transit, ada == TRUE & routes_name == "A") %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, routes_number, routes_name) %>% 
  nrow()

count(filter(transit, ada == TRUE & routes_name == "A") %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, routes_number, routes_name))
```
