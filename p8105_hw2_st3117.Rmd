## Problem 1_1 NYC Transit Data Cleaning

```{r Problem 1_1, message = FALSE}

# import and clean data
transit = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  gather(key = routes_number, value = routes_name, route1:route11) %>% 
  separate(routes_number, into = c("remove1", "routes_number"), sep = 5) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(routes_name)) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", yes = TRUE, no = FALSE)) %>% 
  select(line:station_longitude, routes_number, routes_name, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  arrange(line, station_name)

```

The dataset "transit" is a `r ncol(transit)` by `r nrow(transit)` table.\
It contains variables including line, station_name, latitude, longitude, routes_number, routes_name, entry, vending, entrance_type and ADA compliance.\
I started by importing the dataset and clean the variable names. Then, I used 'gather' function doing a wide to long transpose; used 'separate' function removing characters "route" from routes_number; used 'filter' function removing “NA”s in routes_name; used 'ifelse' function converting entry to a logical variable; seleted the 10 variables as requested; and arrange them by line and station_name.\
</br>
This is a tidy dataset.

## Problem 1_2 Answer Questions

* How many distinct stations are there?\
There are `r count(distinct(transit, line, station_name))` distinct stations.\
</br>
* How many stations are ADA compliant?\
`r count(filter(transit, ada == TRUE) %>% distinct(line, station_name))` stations are ADA compliant.\
</br>
* What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?\
`r round(count(filter(transit, vending == "NO" & entry == TRUE) %>% distinct(line, station_name))*100 /  count(filter(transit, vending == "NO") %>% distinct(line, station_name)), 2)`% station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance.

## Problem 1_3 Reformat Data and Answer Questions

* How many distinct stations serve the A train?\
There are `r count(filter(transit, routes_name == "A") %>% distinct(line, station_name, routes_number, routes_name))` distinct stations serve the A train.\
</br>
* Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?\
`r count(filter(transit, ada == TRUE & routes_name == "A") %>% distinct(line, station_name, routes_number, routes_name))` Of the stations that serve the A train are ADA compliant.

## Problem 2_1 Mr. Trash Wheel Data Cleaning

```{r Problem 2_1}

# import and clean data
trash = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
                     sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = readxl::cell_cols("A:N")) %>%

  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls) %>% 
                   as.integer(sports_balls)
    )

#    year = ifelse(!is.na(year), year, substring(date, 1, 4)),

```


## Problem 2_2 Precipitation Data Cleaning

```{r}

# import and clean data for 2016
prec_2016 = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                     sheet = "2016 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = "2016")

# import and clean data for 2017                             
prec_2017 = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                     sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = "2017") 
  
# note: the previous dataset contains NAs for precipitation thus need ' %>% filter(!is.na(total))', but this one is complete.

# combine the 2016 and 2017 datasets, and change month type
precipitation = 
  bind_rows(prec_2016, prec_2017) %>%
  select(year, month, total) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])

```


## Problem 2_3

```{r}
#filter(trash, year == 2016) %>% 
#  pull(sports_balls) %>% 
#  median()

#median(filter(trash, year == 2016) %>% trash$sports_balls)

count(trash)
count(precipitation)
sum(prec_2017$total)

```

`r median(filter(trash, year == 2016) %>% pull(sports_balls))`

`r nrow(trash)`

`r nrow(precipitation)`

`r sum(prec_2017$total)`
